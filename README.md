# FilmQueryProject

# description

In this project I implemented what I learned in Java ORM and SQL. The program sorts through a given database from my school. This database has the information of a movie rental company. My program can search by one of two ways. One way is by searching for a film's ID number, if a film is found it will display the film's Title, Year of Release, Viewer Rating, Brief description and a list of the actors. The other way to sort through the database is to search a movie by any keyword of your choice. The program will print out every movie that fits the keyword you have entered and will also let you know if no movie was found. * Note: all of the actors and films are not real!
